Hi there! 👋

My name is Natalia, and I’m a third-year student aspiring to become a BI Developer or Data Analyst.
I started my professional journey with an interest in cybersecurity but soon discovered my passion for data analysis. 
This field allows me to fully utilize my analytical thinking skills, draw meaningful conclusions, and ask the right questions.

👩‍💻 Currently, I am developing my skills in:
- **Power BI**: Creating interactive dashboards and reports to support data-driven decision-making. 📊  
- **Python**: Automating tasks and performing data analysis using libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib. 🐍  
- **SQL**: Data cleaning and extracting insights from databases for further analysis. 💾  
- **Excel**: Advanced data analysis, visualizations, and task automation with formulas and macros. 📈  

🏆 Projects and Goals:
- Creating interactive Power BI dashboards.  
- Working on a Python-based app for automating reporting tasks.  
- Improving my skills in data modeling and query optimization in SQL.

✨ A little about me:
I’m passionate about sports – I’ve been going to the gym regularly since 2019 and recently started playing squash.
I love traveling, exploring new cultures, meeting people, and admiring architecture.
I’m fascinated by psychology – I enjoy reading books and watching podcasts on the topic.
Feel free to connect with me or collaborate! I’m always open to questions, feedback, and building new relationships in the field. 😊


**SQL Project**  
In this project, I analyzed a dataset using advanced SQL queries.  
The focus was on data cleaning, aggregation, and extracting valuable insights to support decision-making.
